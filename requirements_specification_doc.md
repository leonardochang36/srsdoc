# Introduction

## Purpose
Set the expectation for the product you’re building. So, start by defining the purpose of your product.

## Scope
Describe the software being specified. Include benefits, objectives, and goals. This should relate to overall business goals, especially if teams outside of development will have access to the SRS

## Definitions and Acronyms
Include any non-trivial definition or acronym used in the document.

# Overall Description
Describe what you’re going to build. Is it an update to an existing product? Is it a new product? Is it an add-on to a product you’ve already created?

These are important to describe upfront, so everyone knows what you’re building.

## User classes
User classes and characteristics are critical. You’ll need to define who (different roles) is going to use the product and how. Don't forget to include each user needs.

## Assumptions and Dependencies
There might be factors that impact your ability to fulfill the requirements outlined in this document. What are those factors?

Are there any assumptions you’re making that could turn out to be false? You should include those here, as well.

Finally, you should note if your project is dependent on any external factors. This might include software components you’re reusing from another project.

# System Features and Requirements
This is where you detail the specific requirements for building your product.

## Functional Requirements
The functional requirements describe the services and functions of a system. Functional requirements must be precise and unambiguous.

Include user stories, which are short descriptions of a feature, told from the perspective of one of your end user profiles. They are typically structured in the following fashion:

> As a __[type of user]__, I want __[some goal]__ so that __[some reason]__.

You may want to use the following template table.

|Title|User story|Importance|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|_Short identifier_|_As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]_|_Must have_|_Write here any additional consideration_|

## External Interface Requirements
External interface requirements are types of functional requirements. They outline how your product will interface with other components or systems.

There are several types of interfaces you may have requirements for, including:
- User
- Hardware
- Software
- Communications

## Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements are restrictions on the system or the development process. Non-functional requirements can be more critical than functional ones. If they are not met, the system is useless!

# Screens
Identifying the individual screens (for an app), or pages (for a website) are where a product’s shape starts to become clear. They are a distillation of the user stories into a set of distinct sections that satisfy the needs and behaviors identified so far. The process of outlining an application’s screens may also highlight any requirements or considerations that have been overlooked up to this point.

This has the dual purpose of both contributing to a more accurate vision of the product early on, and serving as a jumping-off point for the time when designers do get involved.

## Wireframes
Wireframes are simple page layouts that outline the size and placement of elements, and features on a page. They are generally devoid of color, font styles, logos or any design elements.

Wireframing is probably the most time-consuming step of this process and for some simple projects, it may be overkill. For complex projects where serious design thinking needs to happen, wireframes are an indispensable tool.
